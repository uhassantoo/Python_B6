# Python pip
# What is pip?
# pip is the standard package manager for Python. We can use pip to install additional packages that are not available in the Python standard library. For example,

# pip install numpy
# If we had installed pip on our system, this command would have installed the numpy library.

# How to install pip?
# pip comes pre-installed on the Python versions 3.4 or older. We can check if pip is installed by using the following command in the console:

# pip --version
