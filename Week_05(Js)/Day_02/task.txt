JavaScript Form Task
                create a form with a dropdown menu for selecting a country.
                 
                depending on the selected country, dynamically show or hide fields that are 
                specific to that country's address format. For example, if "United States" is selected, 
                show fields for state and ZIP code; if "Canada" is selected, show fields for province 
                and postal code.
